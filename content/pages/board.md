## Code of Conduct

<p>The Chapter Board of Directors (Board) and all Chapter Officers
  commit to ethical, businesslike, and lawful conduct, including
  proper use of authority and appropriate decorum while acting as
  Directors or Officers. At all times, the members of the Board
  are expected to hold themselves to a higher duty of care and
  conduct. Their actions should in no way reflect poorly on the
  Chapter or IMBA.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Board members and Officers must have loyalty to the
    membership of the organization, unconflicted by loyalties to
    staff, other organizations or groups, and any
    self-interest.</li>
  <li>Board members must avoid conflict of interest with respect
    to their fiduciary responsibilities.
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Members will annually disclose their involvements with
      organizations or with vendors, staff or affiliates and any
      other associations that might be reasonably seen as
      representing a conflict of interest.
    </li>
    <li>When the Board is to decide on an issue about which a
      member has an unavoidable conflict of interest, that member
      shall disclose such conflict and recuse him- or herself
      without comment not only from the vote but from the
      deliberation.
    </li>
    <li>Board members will not use their Board position to obtain
      employment in the Chapter for themselves, family members, or
      close associates. A board member who applies for employment
      must first resign from the Board.
    </li>
    <li>An employee who becomes a candidate for the Board shall
      automatically be deemed to be on an extended leave of
      absence during his or her candidacy. An employee candidate
      who successfully becomes a board member shall be deemed to
      have automatically and voluntarily resigned as an employee.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Board members may not attempt to exercise individual
    authority over the organization, its affiliates, or any of
    their parts or staff.
  </li>
  <li>Board members will respect the confidentiality appropriate
    to issues of a sensitive nature.
  </li>
  <li>Board members will be properly prepared for Board
    deliberation.
  </li>
  <li>Board members will support the legitimacy and authority of
    the final determination of the Board on any matter,
    irrespective of the memberâ€™s personal position on the issue.
  </li>
  <li>Board members are bound at all times to comply with all
    federal, state and local laws and regulations that apply to
    the club and its activities. Any Board member that fails to
    comply with any such law or regulation governing the actions
    of the club is subject to impeachment pursuant to the
    provisions of the bylaws. The foregoing includes knowingly and
    purposefully riding on trails on which the applicable
    governing authority has officially prohibited mountain biking
    and the construction or alteration of trails in violation of
    any applicable law or regulation. In addition, a Board
    member's participation in the construction of unauthorized
    trails is presumptively deemed to be in direct conflict with
    the club bylaws and mission statement and shall constitute
    ground for immediate removal from the Board pursuant to the
    procedures set forth in the bylaws.
  </li>
