  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Ride Open Trails</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Respect trail and road closures</em> &mdash; ask a land manager for
      clarification if you are uncertain about the status of a trail. Do not
      trespass on private land. Obtain permits or other authorization as
      required. Be aware that bicycles are not permitted in areas protected as
      state or federal Wilderness.
    </dd>

    <dt>Leave No Trace</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Be sensitive to the dirt beneath you.</em> Wet and muddy trails are more
      vulnerable to damage than dry ones. When the trail is soft, consider other
      riding options. This also means staying on existing trails and not
      creating new ones. Don't cut switchbacks. Be sure to pack out at least as
      much as you pack in.
    </dd>

    <dt>Control Your Bicycle</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Inattention for even a moment could put yourself and others at
        risk.</em> Obey all bicycle speed regulations and recommendations, and
        ride within your limits.
    </dd>

    <dt>Yield Appropriately</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Do your utmost to let your fellow trail users know you're
        coming</em> &mdash; a friendly greeting or bell ring are good
        methods. Try to anticipate other trail users as you ride around
        corners. Bicyclists should yield to other non-motorized trail users,
        unless the trail is clearly signed for bike-only travel. Bicyclists
        traveling downhill should yield to ones headed uphill, unless the trail
        is clearly signed for one-way or downhill-only traffic. In general,
        strive to make each pass a safe and courteous one.
    </dd>

    <dt>Never Scare Animals</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Animals are easily startled by an unannounced approach, a sudden movement
        or a loud noise.</em> Give animals enough room and time to adjust to you. When
        passing horses, use special care and follow directions from the horseback
        riders (ask if uncertain). Running cattle and disturbing wildlife are
        serious offenses.
    </dd>

    <dt>Plan Ahead</dt>
    <dd>
      <em>Know your equipment, your ability and the area in which you are riding and
        prepare accordingly.</em> Strive to be self-sufficient: keep your equipment in
        good repair and carry necessary supplies for changes in weather or other
        conditions. Always wear a helmet and appropriate safety gear.
