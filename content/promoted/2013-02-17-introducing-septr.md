Summary: An introduction to Southeastern Pennsylvania Trail Riders

<p class="lead">Welcome to <abbr title="Southeastern Pennsylvania Trail Riders">SEPTR</abbr>,
the new voice of mountain biking in southeastern Pennsylvania.</p>

In 2006 PMBA was the first chapter of <abbr title="International Mountain
Bicycling Association">IMBA</abbr> in the country. After more than six years
the territory and the club have grown significantly.

In an effort to keep up with change and to accurately represent the growth of
mountain biking in the [five county region](/maps#boundaries) <abbr
title="Philadelphia Mountain Biking Association">PMBA</abbr> has been
restructured and renamed to accurately represent the evolving needs of its
expanded territory.

We are working to make [SEPTR](http://www.septrmtb.org) the authoritative
resource for [regional information about trails](/maps#regional-trails) and
[advocacy](http://www.imba.com/resources/organizing/) in southeastern
Pennsylvania. Please find out more [about SEPTR's mission](/about), discover
and [download maps of our regional trails](/maps), meet the
[board of directors](/board), attend an upcoming [event](/events) and become a
[member](/membership)!
