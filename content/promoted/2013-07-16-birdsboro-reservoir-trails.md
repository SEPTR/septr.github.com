  <p>"I have hiked the grounds many times, and it would be great to have these
  areas accessible [to cyclists]."</p>

</blockquote>

The project is still in a <i>very early</i> stage and its first goal is to fund a
master trail plan to be developed by
[IMBA Trail Solutions](http://www.imba.com/trail-solutions).  The final goal
is to have developed a sustainable trail system at Birdsboro. Since it is within riding distance to the
well-established trail system at
[French Creek State Park](/maps/#french-creek-state-park), riders would have
the opportunity to visit and enjoy both locations during the same ride.
