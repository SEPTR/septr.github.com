        </div>

        <p>The Chapter Board of Directors (Board) and all Chapter Officers
          commit to ethical, businesslike, and lawful conduct, including
          proper use of authority and appropriate decorum while acting as
          Directors or Officers. At all times, the members of the Board
          are expected to hold themselves to a higher duty of care and
          conduct. Their actions should in no way reflect poorly on the
          Chapter or IMBA.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Board members and Officers must have loyalty to the
              membership of the organization, unconflicted by loyalties to
              staff, other organizations or groups, and any
              self-interest.</li>
              <li>Board members must avoid conflict of interest with respect
                to their fiduciary responsibilities.
              </li>
              <ol>
                <li>Members will annually disclose their involvements with
                  organizations or with vendors, staff or affiliates and any
                  other associations that might be reasonably seen as
                  representing a conflict of interest.
                </li>
                <li>When the Board is to decide on an issue about which a
                  member has an unavoidable conflict of interest, that member
                  shall disclose such conflict and recuse him- or herself
                  without comment not only from the vote but from the
                  deliberation.
                </li>
                <li>Board members will not use their Board position to obtain
                  employment in the Chapter for themselves, family members, or
                  close associates. A board member who applies for employment
                  must first resign from the Board.
                </li>
                <li>An employee who becomes a candidate for the Board shall
                  automatically be deemed to be on an extended leave of
                  absence during his or her candidacy. An employee candidate
                  who successfully becomes a board member shall be deemed to
                  have automatically and voluntarily resigned as an employee.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <li>Board members may not attempt to exercise individual
                authority over the organization, its affiliates, or any of
                their parts or staff.
              </li>
              <li>Board members will respect the confidentiality appropriate
                to issues of a sensitive nature.
              </li>
              <li>Board members will be properly prepared for Board
                deliberation.
              </li>
              <li>Board members will support the legitimacy and authority of
                the final determination of the Board on any matter,
                irrespective of the member’s personal position on the issue.
              </li>
              <li>Board members are bound at all times to comply with all
                federal, state and local laws and regulations that apply to
                the club and its activities. Any Board member that fails to
                comply with any such law or regulation governing the actions
                of the club is subject to impeachment pursuant to the
                provisions of the bylaws. The foregoing includes knowingly and
                purposefully riding on trails on which the applicable
                governing authority has officially prohibited mountain biking
                and the construction or alteration of trails in violation of
                any applicable law or regulation. In addition, a Board
                member's participation in the construction of unauthorized
                trails is presumptively deemed to be in direct conflict with
                the club bylaws and mission statement and shall constitute
                ground for immediate removal from the Board pursuant to the
                procedures set forth in the bylaws.
              </li>
